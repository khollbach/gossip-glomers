Efficiency part ii

ideas:
* don't send messages to yourself! (saves at least 1 message-per-op)

* don't send OKs to each other?
    (??)
    * but also somehow stay correct

* batching?
    * hold onto a value for a while, so you can propagate multiple values in a single message
    * concern: might be hard to implement / tune
        (but seems like it'd save us messages)

* something with the topology ..?
    * a binary tree?
    * the given topology? (a 2d grid?)
